Also, submit a write-up of the tweaks you made to the model and the effect they had on the results. Questions to answer: What parameters did you change? What values did you try? Did you try any other changes that made things better or worse? Did they improve or degrade the model? Based on what you observed, what conclusions can you draw about the different parameters and their values?
